Hello everyone and welcome to AC2. There's alot of new stuff here, so take some time to read through this. First off, the game has some cool graphics features that Q009 and I have put quite a bit of work into, and they are not meant to be disabled. This means that the game will stay better looking than most competitive games out there, in which you can decrease graphics significantly to give you a visual advantage. You will find more information about this in an in-game menu. 
  Second, vanilla Sauerbraten maps are not playable in this mod by default (they lack the correct entities), however, we will do our best to keep new maps/map ports coming.
  Third, be aware that alot of aspects of the game are quite unpolished, mostly the bot ai, menus and in-game content.
  Fourth, this game is quite difficult to play and has ALOT of hidden tricks which you will have to find for yourself :) So if you see one of us do something that seems hackish you're probably just watching an advanced player.
  
  
  
  
A list of the current features (SauerEnhanced):

new loading screens
new hud
gui sounds
glow particles
new rain particles
heartbeat and damage screen when health is <=25
new spark particles
new weapon firing effects (muzzle smoke, smoke trails, impact particles & sounds)
new and realistic bullet trails (bullet flares fly through the air)
nearmiss sound if bullets fly near you
new teleport effects
sound when you make a frag, (normal frag, nice-shot frag, team-frag)
lots of under water effects (firing a weapon produces bubbles, underwater weapon sounds have been messed up by me)
profile system which keeps track of many stats
more polished graphics overall



Features(AC2)
occlusion check for bullet flares
colorized hud depending on health
all weapons redone (some with secondaries)
lots of new pickups
entities look more realistic in their enviroment
shield now protects 100% of health
shield chargers: stand in them to regenerate shield
item pickup messages
new frag messages depending on weapon used
zoom key held down to zoom instead of toggle
new blood effects
new explosions
new physics: much harder to use and much faster once you learn it :)
jumping height reduced to be more realistic; make more use of weapon boosts and physics tricks!
no player pain sounds
different playermodels have different die sounds
different gib effects
separate damage screens depending on health
screen jump for certain weapons
hitscan weapons have a basic headshot capability
new item pickup sounds
new weapon sounds
6 maps supported so far (vanilla maps will NOT work with this mod)
new weapon models
new player skins
players get killed if falling too far
new shader which sharpens view (similar to antialiasing)



Known issues:
-bots are behaving badly, I need to fix this :)
-occasionally there will be problems with weapons not respawning (this is pretty rare but should be fixed soon)
-on some maps there may be a problem with spawn points that kills you immediately upon spawning; I've fixed most of this, let me know if there's any more incedents
-pickups not giving you any ammo: this is also a rare server problem (similar to weapons not respawning) which I'll try to fix soon



Things to do/not do:

DO make you own weapon binds, the ones shipped are just the ones I use
DO NOT act like a spambot or troll on the servers
